This Grocery Check List App allows the user to store multiple grocery items that they are planning to buy so they could avoid missing some of the items. The application list all the grocery items and the user can add them by clicking the 'Add New Item' button, and by doing that will trigger the application to open a form modal where the user will enter the item details. Users can also update and delete the item details. Also, the user can mark check to the item that is already on hand. If the item checkbox is marked checked, the item details text color will change and the text will have line-through so the user can easily identify the onhand items. Users can also search for the item from the list.
